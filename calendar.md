## Course Calendar

`Office hours` are in <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span>. You should come to these with questions about anything â€“ labs, homeworks, discussions, concepts, etc. These office hours will be held in-person in Warren Hall 101B, unless otherwise noted.

To access `office hours`, go to the room in the location of the office hour slot you're planning on attending, place your ticket on the [queue](http://oh.ds100.org/) and then a course staff member will call your name when it's your turn.

`Instructor office hours` with Maya and Kevin appear in <span style="color:red">**red**</span>. You should come to these with questions about concepts.

We have also added the following events to the calendar:
- Lectures (in <span style="color:brown">**brown**</span>)
- In-person discussion sections (in <span style="color:orange">**orange**</span>)
- Remote discussion sections (in <span style="color:blue">**blue**</span>)
- Exam prep sections and other reviews (in <span style="color:SeaGreen">**green**</span>)
